# **AI RMF Platform \- Updated Lean MVP Development Plan**

*Solo Developer Path with AI-Assisted Development*

This updated roadmap integrates key suggestions for early value delivery, specifically bringing the **Quiz-Based Assessment** and an **Initial Maturity Model** into the foundational phases, along with a conceptual start to data integration. The assessment will now cover **all four NIST AI RMF functions** earlier in the roadmap.

## **Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Week 1-2)**

**Goal:** Establish development infrastructure and validate core assumptions. This phase remains critical for laying the groundwork without overcomplicating initial offerings.

### **Quick Wins**

* Deploy static landing page with email capture (Vercel/Netlify)  
* Set up analytics (Plausible/SimpleAnalytics \- GDPR compliant)  
* Launch LinkedIn/Twitter presence for building in public

### **Technical Setup**

Stack:  
  Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router) \+ Tailwind CSS \+ shadcn/ui  
  Backend: Supabase (Auth \+ DB \+ Storage)  
  Hosting: Vercel (generous free tier)  
  AI Tools: Cursor/Windsurf IDE, Claude/GPT-4, v0.dev for UI  
  Version Control: GitHub with Actions for CI/CD  
  Monitoring: Sentry (free tier)

### **Validation Metrics**

* Email signups from landing page  
* Initial user interviews (5-10 targets)

## **Phase 1: Interactive AI RMF Assessment & Initial Maturity (Week 3-6)**

**Goal:** Build credibility and gather user data by providing a valuable, free self-assessment tool that offers immediate insights into AI RMF "GOVERN" maturity and prepares for future data integrations. This phase combines the quiz with the maturity model.

### **MVP Feature: NIST AI RMF Self-Assessment & Maturity**

* **Interactive questionnaire (25-30 questions):** Focused exclusively on the **GOVERN** function of the NIST AI RMF, as detailed in the "AI Risk Assessment Quiz: Lightweight Specification."  
* **Instant Maturity Score Visualization:** Immediately display a basic maturity score (e.g., "Emerging," "Developing," "Maturing," "Optimized") based on quiz results for the GOVERN function.  
* **PDF Report Generation with Personalized Recommendations:** Users provide email to receive a detailed report with actionable recommendations tied to their specific "GOVERN" maturity level and identified gaps.  
* **Email Capture for Report Delivery:** Essential for lead generation.  
* **Initial Data Integration (Conceptual):**  
  * **Basic Asset Inventory Input:** Allow users to manually list key AI systems or components they are assessing (e.g., system name, purpose). This acts as a conceptual placeholder for future CMDB/IT inventory integrations, enabling early "mapping" even without direct API connections.  
  * This initial step provides foundational data for linking to other RMF functions later.

### **Validation Metrics**

* Quiz completion rates (\>70%)  
* Email signups for report delivery (\>50%)  
* Initial user interviews focused on quiz usability and report value

## **Phase 2: Account System, Comprehensive Assessment & Dashboard (Month 2-3)**

**Goal:** Enable user accounts, provide a persistent dashboard for tracking comprehensive progress across the *entire AI RMF*, and introduce foundational data aggregation capabilities to support this.

### **MVP Feature: User Accounts & Progress Tracking**

* **User Authentication (Supabase Auth):** Allow users to create accounts to save their assessment results.  
* **Expanded Interactive Questionnaire:** Extend the quiz to include **MAP, MEASURE, and MANAGE** functions. This will significantly increase the total number of questions, covering all four core RMF functions for a holistic self-assessment.  
* **Comprehensive Maturity Score Visualization:** Immediately display a basic maturity score (e.g., "Emerging," "Developing," "Maturing," "Optimized") for *each* of the four RMF functions (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE), and an overall aggregated score.  
* **Personalized Dashboard:** Display saved assessment results, progress on recommendations, and a summary of their overall AI RMF maturity across **all four functions**.  
* **Enhanced PDF Report Generation:** The personalized PDF report now includes detailed recommendations for all four RMF functions based on the expanded quiz results.  
* **Basic Data Aggregation:** Continue to internally structure data from assessments to prepare for cross-functional views, now encompassing all RMF functions.  
* **AI-Powered Enhancements (Early):**  
  * **Basic Contextual Hints:** Small, AI-generated hints within the dashboard or assessment based on previous answers, now covering all RMF functions.

### **Validation Metrics**

* Account creation rate  
* Repeat user visits to dashboard  
* Engagement with saved assessment data and comprehensive scores

## **Phase 3: Smart Roadmap & Basic Integrations (Month 4-6)**

**Goal:** Guide users from assessment to action with dynamic roadmaps and start real-world data integration, enriching the already comprehensive assessment data.

### **MVP Feature: Guided Roadmaps & Foundational Integrations**

* **Smart Roadmap Generation:** Convert comprehensive assessment results and maturity levels into a personalized, prioritized task roadmap for improving maturity across **all four AI RMF functions**.  
* **Task Management Lite:** Allow users to track completion of roadmap tasks within the platform.  
* **Initial *Real* Data Integrations:**  
  * **Focus on 1-2 Common Sources:** Implement basic API integrations with widely used SMB tools (e.g., a popular CMDB, a simple IT asset management tool, or a common cloud platform's inventory API).  
  * **Purpose:** Pull in inventory data (for deeper "MAP" insights on AI systems) and potentially basic risk register data (for richer "MEASURE" insights) to *enrich* the existing assessments and validate self-reported data.  
* **Template Library & Customization:** Expand the library of policies and templates, enabling users to customize them and store within their account.  
* **Basic Version Control for Documents:** Track changes to policies and assessments.

### **Validation Metrics**

* Roadmap task completion rate  
* Number of active integrations  
* User feedback on roadmap usefulness and integration ease

## **Phase 4: Collaborative Features & Scale (Month 7-9)**

**Goal:** Introduce multi-user capabilities, deeper AI insights, and expand content creation.

### **MVP Feature: Team Collaboration & AI Insights**

* **Team Accounts & Roles:** Allow multiple users within an organization with different permissions.  
* **Collaborative Workflows:** Enable shared editing of policies, joint risk assessments, and task assignments.  
* **AI Risk Advisor (Expanded):** LLM-powered assistant for more complex queries related to the NIST AI RMF, interpreting integrated data, and suggesting mitigation strategies based on identified risks across all functions.  
* **Build Template Marketplace Foundation:** Create the infrastructure for external experts to submit and offer templates (initially free or through a vetting process).  
* **Continuous Monitoring, Alerting, & Reporting Dashboards (Enhanced):** Incorporate more metrics from integrated tools into dashboards with configurable alerts.

### **Validation Metrics**

* Number of users per account  
* Engagement with collaborative features  
* Usage of AI Risk Advisor

## **Phase 5: Vertical Packages & Creator Economy (Month 10-12)**

**Goal:** Offer industry-specific solutions and fully activate the creator economy.

### **MVP Feature: Industry Specialization & Content Ecosystem**

* **Vertical Packages:** Offer pre-configured sets of templates, workflows, and risk profiles tailored to specific industries (e.g., Healthcare, FinTech, GovTech), covering all RMF functions.  
* **Full Creator Marketplace:** Enable experts to monetize specialized NIST AI RMF profiles, policies, checklists, and training content. Implement robust content vetting and revenue sharing.  
* **Advanced Analytics:** Deeper insights from integrated data, potentially including automated bias detection (if feasible with available data).  
* **Third-Party AI Risk Management (Expanded):** Comprehensive workflows for assessing and managing risks from third-party AI components/vendors.

### **Validation Metrics**

* Adoption of vertical packages  
* Number of active creators and content sales in marketplace  
* Growth in MRR
