# feedback from chatgpt re: quiz and scoring engine specs - items for consideration

Potential Tweaks

	1.	Tier Boundary Review
 
	•	Current ranges (e.g., 1.2/1.3 and 2.4/2.5) are sharp cutoffs. You might want to set inclusive/exclusive logic explicitly in code to avoid rounding artifacts.
	•	Example: >= 1.3 && <= 2.4 for Developing.
 
	2.	Per-Function Weighting
 
	•	You’ve given fixed function weights for overall scoring (GOVERN 0.3, MAP/MEASURE 0.25, MANAGE 0.2).
Consider documenting the rationale — e.g., GOVERN is foundational, so slightly heavier.

	3.	PDF Report Length
 
	•	Right now, Week 1 report is 2–3 pages and Week 2 is 4–6.
 
Might want to define page-per-function target so writers/designers can plan content blocks.

	4.	Granular Feature Flags
 
	•	You have per-function flags plus ENABLE_FULL_RMF.
 
Decide if ENABLE_FULL_RMF overrides the per-function flags (current behavior) or if per-function flags always take precedence.
	5.	Test Data
 
	•	Include in spec an example JSON responses payload for full RMF so API devs have a clear testing baseline.
