### Core Questions
1. **Current State:** "What's your organization's current biggest AI-related concern or challenge?"
2. **Quiz Clarity:** "How clear were the quiz questions? Were there any that confused you?"
3. **Value Perception:** "Is the maturity score meaningful to you? Does it match your self-assessment?"
4. **Report Value:** "What specific information in the report would be most valuable to your organization?"
5. **Pricing Sensitivity:** "What would make you pay for a detailed report or ongoing access?"
6. **Feature Priorities:** "What other features would be immediately valuable to you?"

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Stack Choices
- **Next.js 14+ with App Router:** Modern React framework with excellent DX, chosen for long-term scalability despite 1-day setup cost
- **TypeScript:** Type safety reduces bugs when working with AI assistance
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui:** Rapid UI development with consistent design system
- **Supabase:** All-in-one backend (auth, database, storage) with generous free tier
- **Vercel:** Seamless Next.js deployment with excellent free tier
- **Resend:** Simple email API, free for 100 emails/day

### Development Tools
- **Cursor/Windsurf:** AI-assisted IDE for 80% code generation

- **v0.dev:** UI component generation
- **GitHub Copilot:** Inline code suggestions

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Next.js complexity:** Mitigated by using AI assistance and established patterns
- **PDF generation issues:** Fallback to pre-generated template if dynamic generation fails
- **Email deliverability:** Monitor Resend metrics, have backup provider ready

### Business Risks
- **Low engagement:** Daily monitoring and rapid iteration based on metrics
- **Legal concerns:** Clear disclaimers from Day 1, no medical/financial advice
- **Scope creep:** Strict adherence to two-week timeline, defer nice-to-haves
